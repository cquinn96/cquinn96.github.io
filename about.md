Software Engineer based in Belfast.
QUB Graduate (MEng Computer Science).

I'm passionate about all things technology related, especially self driving cars. I also love travelling and meeting new people from different cultures and backgrounds. This site is mainly a blog about what I get up to and general things that I'm interested in.

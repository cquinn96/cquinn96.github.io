I’m currently a student of Computer Science MEng at Queen’s University Belfast. As part of my course I am undertaking a years placement with a software development company headquartered in Belfast and I'm loving it so far.

I have a passion for all things technology related. I also love to travel and meet new people from around the world. This site will mainly be a blog about what I get up to and general things that I'm interested in.

Feel free to contact me on twitter [@cquinn96](https://twitter.com/cquinn96).

Thanks for reading!

title: IHG Point Break Hotel Map
---

I recently started travelling with work and have begun building up IGH Reward Points. This is great but it takes several weeks to build up enough points 

Most of you reading this probably know what IHG point breaks are, but for the unaware it's when IHG reduce certain hotel point redemptions to 5,000 points per night in select hotels around the world.

This can mean a saving of over 20,000 points on some hotels per night which is amazing! However, I've always found it quite tricky to spot the hotels I'm interested in when IHG release the (fairly long) list of hotels every few months. So I decided to create a map of these hotels which will help me, and hopefully some of you, to plan trips.

In red are the hotels which are currently sold out.
In blue is the hotels that are still up for grabs.

If you click the icon on the top left of the map, you can select/deselect which categories you want to see on the map (Remaining/Sold Out). In that pane you can also view a list of the hotels in each catorgory and click on them to bring you to it's location. There is also a buttion to view the map full screen.

I will try and keep this updated regularrly (more often when a new list has been released).

Hey folks

The internship program is run by CRCC Asia. Normally students have to pay to get onto the program, which includes accommodation, business seminars and cultural events, etc. but I was awarded a fully funded scholarship by the government. The internship lasts 2 months and is based in Shenzhen, China. On top of this, CRCC Asia offered me the chance to take part in The Dragon Trip, which is a 20 day tour of China and includes stops at cities like Xi’an to see the Terracotta Warriors and Beijing to camp out on the Great Wall of China for a night and much more… so I of course jumped at the opportunity. It cost me a pretty penny, but I didn’t know when I would have the chance to do something like this again. Also we are going to see pandas!

I flew with Emirates from Dublin to Hong Kong, with a 3 hour layover in Dubai which broke up the journey nicely. The flight took about 20 hours. I then took the ferry from Hong Kong airport to Shekou ferry terminal in Shenzhen where I met our program coordinators, which took about 1 hour and then we all crammed into a mini van and made our way to our apartments. All in all, the total journey time was roughly 24 hours. I slept for about 3 hours of that, so I was very, very tired.

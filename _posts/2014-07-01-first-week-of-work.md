title: First Week of Work
---

So I’ve just completed my first working week in China. On our first day, the other interns and I met the CRCC program coordinators early in the morning who escorted us to each of our respective companies that we would be interning with. I didn’t know what to expect, although I’ve done a few different internships before so I wasn’t too nervous this time thankfully. I’m interning with fellow Irishman (the one I met in Dublin airport on the way over) which I think helped too. We met our supervisor, Patricia, who was very friendly and invited us to introduce ourselves to the whole office (we tried in Chinese!). We then sat down at our desks and got an overview of the project and the company itself. Patricia speaks English quite well, but most of the other workers do not, although everyone was very nice and welcoming.

My first impressions were generally quite positive. The project that I was assigned to looks very interesting, and although the team had already done quite a lot of work on it, there was still some way to go until it would be finished. It’s a web based tablet application that handles factory inspections for a large inspection company in Asia. I was excited to set up my development environment and get stuck into the development, but first I needed to read the documentation and understand the fairly complex system which took up most of the week.

On our first day we were brought to McDonalds for lunch which I was a bit surprised by; If a Chinese person was visiting Ireland for the first time I don’t think the first place I would bring them is a McDonalds or an authentic Chinese restaurant – they could get that in China! I would have them eating an Irish fry up or some homemade Irish Stew. ![float-left](/images/Lunch-at-Work-300x168.jpg "Lunch at work") On the second day our coworkers invited us to have lunch with them in the canteen so of course I said yes, jumping at the opportunity to have some authentic Chinese food. Unfortunately it was bland, and overall wasn’t anything to get excited about. I really struggled to get the fishbones out with just chopsticks too. Our coworkers told us that this was just cheap plain food, and even they don’t really like it themselves so it made me more hopefull for future meals. I quickly noticed that they didn’t sell water in the canteen. It’s apparently bad for your stomach to mix so much boiled rice with water… who knew? I’ll have to trust the Chinese on that one. By day 4 I was dreaming of that McDonalds again, and on day 5 the other intern and I caved and went and got a cheeseburger meal. I felt ashamed, and so I said I would go on the hunt for a good Chinese restaurant nearby next week. 

Another thing that I didn’t know about before joining my company is that they allow just over 2 hours for lunch, which was completely new to me as I was used to 30-45 minutes or so back home. The reason they get so long is that most of the workers take a nap at their desks straight after eating... the first time I came back after lunch and seen the lights off, I was slightly confused. I haven’t joined them in napping yet, but there’s still time!

I’ve organised a trip to XiChong beach for this weekend with a few other interns, and I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve seen pictures and heard about the overcrowding at Chinese beaches which is why I choose a beach far outside the city, hopefully it pays off…

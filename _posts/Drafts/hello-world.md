Welcome to my site! I finally decided that I wanted/needed to have a website, even if it's just for shamelessly self plugging anything that I create or do. Plus, what kind of techie would I be if I didn't have my own website?

For the first while, this blog will probably consist of things I've done in the past that I've always meant to blog about but didn't get round too.

So explore away, and I'll add a link to contact me soon.

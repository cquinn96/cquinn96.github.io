So I finally visited Hong Kong!! This has been a dream for me ever since I was small. I was fortunate enough to get a double entry visa for China when I applied, well you might call it luck, but I was very persistent as I knew I had to visit HK while I was in Shenzhen. Theyâ€™re literally right beside each other.

Anyway, after receiving some time off work from my supervisor, I booked 1 night in a fancy hotel outside of the city, and 3 nights in a guesthouse right in the centre of HK.

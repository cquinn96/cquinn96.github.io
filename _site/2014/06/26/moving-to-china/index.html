  <h1 class="post-title">Moving to China</h1>
  <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2014</span>
  <p>Hi there! As a bit of background to this post, I was offered 2 internships for this summer. One was based in the USA and the other was in China. Now this was an extremely tough decision for me to have to make. I’ve always wanted to visit/live in the US and now I was offered a paid internship, with accommodation and flights included. I’d never even thought about living in China before, but having this offer for an internship piqued my interest. After doing some more research and a lot of deliberating (ask my girlfriend, she’ll certainly tell you) I settled on China. Why? I don’t have a definitive answer. But the company that I will be interning with, seemed to have quite a good reputation in the IT sector. I also thought that I would more than likely never have the chance to live in China so easily again in my life, so why not? I got started on some Pimsleur’s beginner Mandarin lessons right away.</p>

<p>A few months later and I finished my placement year in Belfast, and the time had come to leave for China. <img src="/images/Me-at-Dublin-Airport-300x168.jpg" alt="float-right" title="Me at Dublin airport"> I’d bought everything I needed and researched where I was going countless times but I still couldn’t believe it was happening, right up to the night before I was due to leave.</p>

<p>The internship program is run by CRCC Asia. Normally students have to pay to get onto the program, which includes accommodation, business seminars and cultural events, etc. but I was awarded a fully funded scholarship by the government. The internship lasts 2 months and is based in Shenzhen, China. On top of this, CRCC Asia offered me the chance to take part in The Dragon Trip, which is a 20 day tour of China and includes stops at cities like Xi’an to see the Terracotta Warriors and Beijing to camp out on the Great Wall of China for a night and much more… so I of course jumped at the opportunity. It cost me a pretty penny, but I didn’t know when I would have the chance to do something like this again. Also we are going to see pandas!</p>

<p>I flew with Emirates from Dublin to Hong Kong, with a 3 hour layover in Dubai which broke up the journey nicely. The flight took about 20 hours. I then took the ferry from Hong Kong airport to Shekou ferry terminal in Shenzhen where I met our program coordinators, which took about 1 hour and then we all crammed into a mini van and made our way to our apartments. All in all, the total journey time was roughly 24 hours. I slept for about 3 hours of that, so I was very, very tired.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Apartment-300x168.jpg" alt="float-left" title="My apartment">
We arrived at the apartment at about 6pm and were told that we would have an informal dinner at 7. Most of us hurried up to our rooms and had a quick shower before meeting back in the lobby at 6.45. Still exhausted but excited, I went for my first Chinese meal. We walked to a nearby shopping mall and had a table waiting for us. The food was strange, but nice. This probably wasn’t the best time for me to start learning how to use chopsticks, although I had no choice otherwise I wasn’t going to be eating! It’s Chinese custom for one person, usually the most senior, to order food for everyone and it will be placed in the middle of the table and shared (everyone uses chopsticks to fill their own plates). <img src="/images/First-Meal-300x168.jpg" alt="float-right" title="First meal in China"> Something which I found even more peculiar was that the noodles and rice come last, once you’ve finished your meat and veg. I found out that the reason for this is because restaurants want to give you the best food first, and they consider rice and noodles ‘filler food’. What’s Chinese for ‘bring everything out all at once’?</p>

<p>After the meal we all went back to our apartments. I got into bed almost immediately as I was still completely exhausted from the journey and I had to be up at 7am to go to our induction the following day. I still could hardly believe that I was in China.</p>

<p>Anyway, heres to 3 months of adventure!</p>

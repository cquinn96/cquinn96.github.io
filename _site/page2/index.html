        Induction Day and First Weekend in China
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>I managed to get up on time for the CRCC induction day… although I don’t know how. We were taxied to a hotel in downtown Shenzhen, where we had our first Chinese breakfast. I can’t say that I overly enjoyed it, but I was too hungry to care. It consisted of dumplings and noodles along with hot water to wash it down. Oh and of course chopsticks. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of noodles but for breakfast it wouldn’t be my first choice.</p>

This was the first time I had tried dumplings though and they were very good. We barely had time to finish before we were whisked upstairs and were formally introduced to the CRCC Asia team. They all were very friendly and seemed really helpful. We introduced ourselves one by one (there was about 30 interns) and were given our Chinese business cards and were taught how to give/receive them in China (you give your card with 2 hands with the card facing up, and when you are receiving, you accept the card with 2 hands again and you don’t put it away straight away; you should read it, and ask questions based on it).</p>

<p>We were also taught the meaning of guanxi (关系), which is a Chinese concept. It loosely translates to relationships or connections, but it means so much more in Chinese culture, especially in the Chinese world of business, which is built on guanxi.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Chinese-English-300x168.jpg" alt="float-left" title="Chinese-English; A sign in the lift of my apartment.">
Another word we learned was miànzi (面子), which is the Chinese idea of ‘face’. Say for example, you got angry and started shouting on the street you would lose face, or if you paid for everyone’s meal you would gain face. Another way of putting it is that miànzi represents social perceptions of a person’s prestige. I think this is a great concept that I feel isn’t used enough in Western culture.</p>

<p>We were then taught some beginner Mandarin phrases to help us get by until Monday (our first full Chinese lesson), which I really enjoyed. I learnt how to say 1-99 and a couple of other phrases. Now you might think, learning 1-99 is a lot for a 30 minute beginner lesson but not with Chinese. You see, once you can say 1-9 you can reuse these numbers to form any number up to 99. So for 56 you would say wǔ (5) shí (10) liù (6). Simple. Then once you know the word for 100 you can say up to 999 and so on. I think this is an excellent numbering system.</p>

That evening we had our official welcome dinner, which consisted of… food, I think. I still wasn’t used to the dishes coming out one by one, and we would demolish one plate of some kind of meat or vegetables and have to wait 5 minutes for the next. But we ordered a couple of beers and got to know each other a bit better. After the meal, we went out to the bar/nightclub part of the city. It was quite different from what I was expecting, the reason being is that it was very western (we went to the western bar and club area of Shenzhen known as Coco Park). We split up as no one really knew where to go or how to keep in touch with the rest so our group went to the Irish bar, McCawley’s. I was excited when I seen where we were going, but in the end was a bit disappointed by the bar. Firstly I was the only Irish person in sight (in a city of 13 million people I was a bit surprised), but then I found out why; A pint was roughly £5.50. I almost have cried. But we stayed for a few, and had ended up having a great night out. I slept until about 3pm the next day (I’m going to blame the jet-lag for this, not the alcohol) and when I got up, found out that the plan was to go to a pool in the Venice Hotel, which is a very swanky hotel in the middle of Shenzhen. We got there expecting to pay an entrance fee but there didn’t seem to be one and the staff didn’t mention anything, and we had the huge pool all to ourselves. Fantastic.</p>

<p>The next day a group of us decided to go to Shenzhen zoo. It was quite expensive (£20), but I made the most out of it… I had a snake around my neck, I rode an elephant and I fed crocodiles some meat. We also got a chance to go out in the lake. The most disappointing thing though, was that one of the lions looked severely malnourished. To the point where I couldn’t believe that they would let this happen in a zoo and so we just left soon after. We got taxi’s back to the apartment and I slept like a baby as soon as I got in the door.</p>

<p>So that was my first weekend in China, so far so good. I start work on tomorrow (Monday) morning so I’ll be sure to make a post about my first week working here.</p>
